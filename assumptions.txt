- "Environment"  in the problem statement is talking about a computing space that contains anything the employee needs
- The environment does not sound emphemeral, considering it's dealing with persisent data storage (SQL)

- Python 3 is being used, and not 2
- "Login to a linux shell on the server" SSH or Systems Manager
